## Features

* In DevZen, you can write your code in HTML, CSS, JS.
* It `Saves` your code even on exiting the page so that your progress is not lost.
* In the downward section you can even see `live` run of the code.
* You don't need to connect css and js files with html, they are already connected.
* You can use `Open` and `Close` button to minimize and maximize a section.

Also the website has a favicon icon to enhance its UI and increase its authenticity.
